**NU FlyEye: Analysis** is part of the **NU FlyEye** platform for studying gene expression in the developing *Drosophila* eye. The analysis package provides methods for analyzing expression data measured in vivo using **NU FlyEye: Silhouette**.


Given one or more ``.silhouette`` files, the analysis package facilitates:

   - **Timeseries Construction.** Convert measurements to timepoints

   - **Data Management.** Query cells by developmental age and cell type

   - **Dynamic Analysis.** Analyze and visualize expression dynamics

   - **Spatial Analysis.** Detect and quantify spatial expression patterns

The initial release is primarily limited to basic tools required to replicate `our study <https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/pnt_yan_ratio>`_ of Pnt and Yan expression during retinal patterning in *Drosophila*. We intend to expand this functionality in later releases.
