**NU FlyEye: Analysis** is part of the **NU FlyEye** platform for studying gene expression in the developing *Drosophila* eye. The analysis package provides methods for analyzing expression data measured *in vivo* using **NU FlyEye: Silhouette**.


Given one or more ``.silhouette`` files, **NU FlyEye: Analysis** facilitates:

   - **Timeseries Construction:** convert measurements to timepoints
   - **Data Management:** query cells by developmental age and cell type
   - **Dynamic Analysis:** analyze and visualize expression dynamics
   - **Spatial Analysis:** detect and quantify spatial expression patterns

The initial release is primarily limited to basic tools required to replicate `our study <https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/pnt_yan_ratio>`_ of Pnt and Yan expression during retinal patterning in *Drosophila*. We intend to expand this functionality in later releases.
